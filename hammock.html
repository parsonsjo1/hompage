		<h1>Hammocking</h1>
		<b>Equipment: </b> <i>hammock, blanket, and an open mind.</i>
		<b>Weather: </b> <i>best at night when the stars are shining.</i>

		<h3>What It Is</h3>
		<p>A hammock is a canvas or rope netting that is suspended by two cords connected at two points.
		<br>The purpose of a hammock is to provide the user with a most delightful napping experience.
		<br>Most hammocks in the world are very comfortable and will cause the user to fall asleep if used for too long.</p>

		<h3>What To Be Aware Of</h3>
		<p>A hammock can be a dangerous piece of equipment. If one is not careful they may fall asleep and end up as a bear snack.
		<br>Always be aware of where you are hanging your hammock. Make sure that it is a nice shady spot away from big bad animals.
		<br>Big animals are not the only thing to be on the look out for. One should be prepared to face the blood thirsty mosquitoes that are found just about everywhere.</p>
