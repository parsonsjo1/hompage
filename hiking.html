		<b>Equipment: </b> <i>boots, walking stick, and strong feet.</i>

		<h3>What It Is</h3>

		<br>The purpose of a hiking is to explore the beautiful outdoors and to see mother nature, when she is not upset. 
		<br>There are many places to hike around the world and there may even be one right outside your door, so go explore!</p>
		<br>

		<h3>What To Be Aware Of</h3>
		<p>Hiking can be a dangerous adventure. There may be vicious snakes, lions, or mountain goats along the trail.
		<br>Be sure to be aware at all times while you are hiking because you never know when danger will strike.
